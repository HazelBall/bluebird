				<h1>Bluebirds</h1>
				<p><img style = "margin: 0 2.5%;" class = "half left" src = "images/11.JPG">In Colorado, Bluebirds can be found almost everywhere. Migrating in February and March into the area during mating season, they are a sign of spring to many. Bluebirds usually create small, bowl shaped nests in crevices in trees, mailboxes, and other spaces.</p>
				<p>Bluebirds usually have two broods in each season, each brood with four to five eggs. Nestboxes, or birdhouses, can help guard these eggs, and help the Bluebirds create nests when other places do not provide adequateshelter. These boxes are easy to create, and Bluebirds will easily accept them for nests.</p>

				<h4>Bluebird Facts</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Three species of Bluebirds are found in Colorado, Mountain, Western, and Eastern Bluebirds</li>
					<li>Bluebirds are songbirds, and the males will sing at certain points in the day or while flying</li>
					<li>Most bluebirds will accept nestboxes and birdhouses instead of cavities and crevices easily</li>

				<h1>Birdhouses</h1>
				<p><img style = "margin: 0 2.5%;" class = "third left" src = "images/08.JPG">Bluebird nest boxes, or birdhouses, allow Bluebirds to find easy places to brood during the mating season. Although location differs slightly for each species of Bluebird, nestboxes can be placed in most meadows, feilds, and forests.</p>
				<p>Nestboxes are usually set up on posts, but can be set up on trees, fences, and anything else, as long as the entrance is accessible to the Bluebirds and does not put them in any danger.</p>

					<h3>Birdhouse Tips</h3>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>Place your birdhouses in meadows to attract Eastern and Mountain Bluebirds</li>
						<br>
						<li>Try to make the entrance to your birdhouse face east, as that is where most birds will be migrating from</li>
						<br>
						<li>If you want, you can add a predator guard to make sure other birds don't attack eggs and fledglings</li>
						<br>
						<li>Bluebirds like small grass, so they can find worms and other insects on the ground to eat</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>If you follow the building instructions and use the tips provided, your Birdhouse should be a perfect spot for bluebirds during the mating season!</p>
